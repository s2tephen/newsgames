## It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.

Welcome to **The Newsgame Design Toolkit**. This site was created in Spring 2014 as my final project for Ethan Zuckerman's [Future of News and Participatory Media](http://partnews.brownbag.me/) class at MIT. Here, I explore the concept and specific instances of the *newsgame*, and lay out a basic methodology for creating newsgames. By and large, this is a resource on game *design*, not game *development*, but feel free to check the Resources section for more technical assistance. Moreover, this is an opinionated guide that subscribes to a particular vision of the newsgame as well as certain design methodologies.

You can find my original pitch for this project over on the [MAS.700 blog](http://partnews.brownbag.me/2014/04/16/stephens-final-project-proposal-press-play-on-newsgames/). Originally, I was tinkering with the idea of building an actual tool a la [The Cartoonist](http://www.bogost.com/blog/cartoonist.shtml), but this was deemed out of scope. I plan to revisit that concept as a project in the future. Special thanks goes to the [Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.com/1.0/en/), where much of the inspiration for this format comes from. Note that this is a work in progress, and I'm always looking for contributions from others â€” if you're interested in adding content, submit a pull request over on [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/s2tephen/newsgames). If you have no idea what that means, just [shoot me an email](mailto:ssuen@mit.edu) and we'll talk.
