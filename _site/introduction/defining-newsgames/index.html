          <h2>Defining Newsgames</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>In <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Newsgames-Journalism-Play-Ian-Bogost/dp/0262014874">Newsgames: Journalism at Play</a></em> (more or less <em>the</em> book on the subject — you can read <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/09/book-excerpt-can-videogames-be-journalism/62663/">an excerpt over at <em>The Atlantic</em></a>), authors Bogost, Ferrari, and Schweizer generically define newsgames as “a term that names a broad body of work produced at the intersection of videogames and journalism.” In the book, they go on to detail the various subgenres that have emerged in the field of newsgames:

<ul>
  <li>current event games, e.g. <a href="http://www.tiltfactor.org/play-layoff/"><em>Layoff</em></a> or <a href="http://gamethenews.net/wp-content/games/endgamesyria/"><em>Endgame: Syria</em></a></li>
  <li>infographic games, e.g. <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/budget-hero"><em>Budget Hero</em></a> or “playable infographics”</li>
  <li>documentary games, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFK:_Reloaded"><em>JFK: Reloaded</em></a> or <a href="http://newsgames.gatech.edu/blog/2009/04/berlin-wall-map-for-garys-mod.html"><em>Berlin Wall</em></a></li>
  <li>puzzle games, e.g. crosswords or quizzes (<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/quizzes"><em>BuzzFeed</em>, anyone?</a>)</li>
  <li>literacy games, e.g. <a href="http://www.newsu.org/courses/be-reporter-game"><em>Be a Reporter</em></a> (requires signup)</li>
  <li>community games, e.g. alternate reality games such as <a href="http://worldwithoutoil.org/"><em>World Without Oil</em></a></li>
</ul>

<p>So, when we say newsgames, it’s much more than the typical AAA gameplay experiences you might be used to — just by looking at the sheer diversity within the indie scene, it’s readily apparent that the definition of what makes a “game” has broadened significantly. Honestly, if you talk to professional game designers or developers, they’ll probably tell you that they’re sick of the debate.</p>

<p>Within the world of news apps, it can be hard to differentiate newsgames from interactive graphics — for example, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-13/interactive-simulation-how-to-mine-bitcoin"><em>BusinessWeek</em>’s bitcoin mining simulator</a> has many of the attributes of a game. The most trafficked story on <em>The New York Times’</em> website last year was a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/20/sunday-review/dialect-quiz-map.html">quiz that identified different dialects</a>. Not exactly <em>Counter-Strike</em>, but in a broad sense, it was definitely a “playful experience.”</p>

<p>This toolkit will focus on a more concrete definition of games, as provided by Salen and Zimmerman in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rules-Play-Game-Design-Fundamentals/dp/0262240459">Rules of Play</a></em> (a highly recommended book for a more structured approach to game design): “a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome.” Neatly enough, this formulation gives us three entry points for creating games from news stories: conflicts, rules, and outcomes.</p>
